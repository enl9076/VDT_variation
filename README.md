# VDT_variation
 This project is a microcontroller-based variation of the well-known Voodoo Doll Task often used in aggression and other psychological research.
 
 ## About the project
 I am a psychological researcher and as such have often used the Voodoll task (see ) in online and laboratory experiments. This behavioral task is typically used to measure aggressive behavior but after using it several times myself I noticed one major drawback - the *way* it measured aggression, which is simily by the number of pins participants choose to stick in the doll (virtually, if deployed online). I wanted to alter the task to be able to capture *physical aggression* a bit more accurately/objectively, so I thought about finding a way to gauge *hard* participants are pushing in the pins. This is where the microcontrollers come in.
